                  Pupils of the 21st century cannot and should not receive an
                  education that was created centuries ago to suit an
                  environment that no longer exists. Todayâ€™s complex world
                  requires fluid and dynamic learning that is relevant to a
                  world that is changing exponentially at a rapid rate. This is
                  where Belvedere School, Cairo incorporates STEAM education
                  within the curriculum, allowing pupils to learn through life
                  experiences rather than textbooks. Through project-based,
                  inquiry-based, and problem-based learning, interdisciplinary
                  and multidisciplinary learning activities are created with a
                  learning environment that fosters 21st-century skills.

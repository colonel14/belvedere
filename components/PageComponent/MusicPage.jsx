                  Just like Mathematics, Music is considered by many a universal
                  language, and we feel the same at Belvedere. Our pupils will
                  attend regular music lessons to discover global rhythms,
                  tempos, and instruments that will fuel their love for music.
                  Through music instruction, pupils make scholarly improvements,
                  gainsocial skills, and find a creativeoutlet. Moreover,
                  playing instruments improves dexterity and hand-eye
                  coordination, as the need to perform simultaneous tasks
                  fosters brain development. Music education is also an
                  exceptional method to develop memorisation skills. Since
                  pupils will be playing an instrument, reading sheet music, and
                  recalling lyrics at the same time, the brainâ€™s memory centre
                  is in constant motion.

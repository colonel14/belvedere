                  Drama at Belvedere is more than annual performances; it is a
                  means for our pupils to develop creative abilities, find their
                  own unique voices, and practise self-expression. We encourage
                  our pupils to come together through drama to share their
                  thoughts, ideas, and interpretations. At Belvedere, creative
                  expression is one of several outlets aimed at providing pupils
                  with a rich and rewarding environment. In addition to better
                  academic performance, participating in drama and theatre
                  significantly improves confidence and oneâ€™s perception of the
                  self. Pupils are taught collaboration and listening skills,
                  encouraged to speak up and express themselves, and ultimately
                  develop empathy for others.

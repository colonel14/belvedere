                  On the surface, learning through the arts teaches pupils about
                  colour, layout, perspective, and balance, but beneath all
                  that, it carries a much bigger influence on their academic and
                  personal growth. From developing motor, verbal, social,
                  decision- making, risk-taking, and imaginative skills to
                  dissecting complex ideas and innovating solutions, Art and
                  Design can truly transform pupilsâ€™ learning. Pupils at
                  Belvedere will benefit from an Art and Design programme
                  designed to promote a sense of confidence, collaboration, and
                  self-expression. Our Belvedere values of celebrating diversity
                  and success teach our pupils to take pride in their work,
                  support their classmates, and accept failure as an opportunity
                  to try again.

      Established in 1880, the Belvedere School is an independent co-educational
      school that has been part of Liverpoolâ€™s educational landscape for more
      than 140 years.


      We share their legacy of quality and core beliefs, and we are proud of our
      close ties to Belvedere. We look forward to using their pedagogical know-
      how and incorporating the best of independent premium British education
      into our school.


      Belvedere School, Cairo is directly overseen by Belvedere School in the UK
      to ensure the school reflects the policies, academic excellence, and
      teaching quality that represent Belvedere UK. Teacher training will be
      conducted under the guidance of Belvedere School UK to maintain the same
      level of teaching and learning.

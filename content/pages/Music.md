      Just like Mathematics, Music is considered by many a universal language,
      and we feel the same at Belvedere. Our pupils will attend regular music
      lessons to discover global rhythms, tempos, and instruments that will fuel
      their love for music. Through music instruction, pupils make scholarly
      improvements, gainsocial skills, and find a creativeoutlet. Moreover,
      playing instruments improves dexterity and hand-eye coordination, as the
      need to perform simultaneous tasks fosters brain development. Music
      education is also an exceptional method to develop memorisation skills.
      Since pupils will be playing an instrument, reading sheet music, and
      recalling lyrics at the same time, the brainâ€™s memory centre is in
      constant motion.

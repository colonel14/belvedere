      The Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) sets the standards that all must
      meet to ensure that children learn and develop well and are kept healthy
      and safe. We understand and value the importance of learning through
      educational play in a child-initiated environment. Our EYFS gives us a
      unique opportunity to provide a balance between EYFS principles and
      practices, and the more school-like routines and educational practices at
      Key Stage 1.

      Sports education is a significant pillar of the academic journey, and at
      Belvedere, we have established comprehensive sports facilities and
      academic programmes that seamlessly integrate sports instruction.
      Belvedere pupils will have access to facilities that allow them to
      practise a myriad of sports within a safe and healthy environment.
      Physical activity through sports increases physical abilities and is also
      linked with improved motor and mental skills. Moreover, the nature of
      individual and team sports introduces pupils to routines and practices
      crucial to developing and maintaining healthier lifestyles

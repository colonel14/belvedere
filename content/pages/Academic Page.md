  At Belvedere School, Cairo pupils take ownership of what they learn by
  focusing on how the new knowledge solves a problem or adds value, instead of
  simply being given information and waiting for the correct answer. This preps
  them for their ever-changing future. Many of the jobs which our young people
  will be applying for in years to come have not even been invented yet.


  We believe the ability to develop critical thinking skills and thinking
  flexibility, is vital

      Pupils of the 21st century cannot and should not receive an education that
      was created centuries ago to suit an environment that no longer exists.
      Todayâ€™s complex world requires fluid and dynamic learning that is relevant
      to a world that is changing exponentially at a rapid rate. This is where
      Belvedere School, Cairo incorporates STEAM education within the
      curriculum, allowing pupils to learn through life experiences rather than
      textbooks. Through project-based, inquiry-based, and problem-based
      learning, interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary learning activities are
      created with a learning environment that fosters 21st-century skills.

body: "At Belvedere School, Cairo pupils take ownership of what they learn by focusing on how the new knowledge solves a problem or adds value, instead of simply being given information and waiting for the correct answer. This preps them for their ever-changing future. Many of the jobs that our young people will be applying for in years to come have not even been invented yet.\n\n\ We believe the ability to develop critical thinking skills and\_ thinking flexibility, is vital\n"

      School trips at Belvedere are an indispensable aspect of the pupils’
      journeys. Acting as both a complementary learning tool and a social
      activity, trips provide pupils with real-life interpretations of the
      topics they are learning. While our school trips are mainly educational
      efforts to contextualise learning, they serve a much greater purpose.
      Through experiencing an out-of-school setting, pupils understand that
      learning is not confined to a classroom and that it is, in fact, a
      lifelong skill that exists within us. Every trip planned by the school is
      designed to include activities that encourage creative problem- solving,
      foster interpersonal and intrapersonal skills, and strengthen the bond
      between Belvedere pupils and teachers. In line with Belvedere’s values,
      trips are a part of the school’s endeavours to create an enriching
      environment for pupils that broadens their horizons and leads to academic
      and personal successes.

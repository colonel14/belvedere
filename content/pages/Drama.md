      Drama at Belvedere is more than annual performances; it is a means for our
      pupils to develop creative abilities, find their own unique voices, and
      practise self-expression. We encourage our pupils to come together through
      drama to share their thoughts, ideas, and interpretations. At Belvedere,
      creative expression is one of several outlets aimed at providing pupils
      with a rich and rewarding environment. In addition to better academic
      performance, participating in drama and theatre significantly improves
      confidence and oneâ€™s perception of the self. Pupils are taught
      collaboration and listening skills, encouraged to speak up and express
      themselves, and ultimately develop empathy for others.

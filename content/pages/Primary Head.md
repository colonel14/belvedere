      produces well-rounded learners prepared for the challenges of today’s
      fast-paced world. Our school community is made up of and belongs to our
      pupils and their parents, so we hope to constantly work hand-in-hand to
      maintain the warm family atmosphere and academic excellence that define
      Belvedere.

      At Belvedere, we believe that every child can achieve greatness and that
      greatness is always unique. I am delighted to lead the Primary School in
      Belvedere School, Cairo as it grows to welcome pupils and families who

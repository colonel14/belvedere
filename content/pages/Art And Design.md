      On the surface, learning through the arts teaches pupils about colour,
      layout, perspective, and balance, but beneath all that, it carries a much
      bigger influence on their academic and personal growth. From developing
      motor, verbal, social, decision- making, risk-taking, and imaginative
      skills to dissecting complex ideas and innovating solutions, Art and
      Design can truly transform pupilsâ€™ learning. Pupils at Belvedere will
      benefit from an Art and Design programme designed to promote a sense of
      confidence, collaboration, and self-expression. Our Belvedere values of
      celebrating diversity and success teach our pupils to take pride in their
      work, support their classmates, and accept failure as an opportunity to
      try again.
